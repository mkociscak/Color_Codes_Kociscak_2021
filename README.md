# project_1_2021
This is my first project with Code Louisville!

My home page displays nine different colors in boxes. Each color box displays the color's hex code. Each hex code is a link that will lead to a new page displaying an original oil painting that includes the particular color of the hex code.

My three features are as follows:
    1). CSS Grid: I used CSS Grid to make the layout on the home page to organize the color boxes. For mobile devices the layout is based on a 3x3 grid. At 769 pixels an additional column is added, changing the grid to 4x3 for tablet devices. At 1282 pixels another column is added, changing the grid to 5x2 for wider, horizontally oriented screens.

    2). Navigation menu: My basic navigation menu is located at the bottom of the pages and was made using CSS Flexbox properties. For mobile devices this menu is laid out vertically with horizontal bands as the separate links. At 769 pixels in width these bands switch to rectangular shapes laid out side by side to spread out for wider screens.

    3). JavaScript Forms: Each page featuring an original painting includes two form elements that pose simple questions to the viewer and can be validated by corresponding alert responses after clicking the "Enter" buttons.



I hope to build on this project in the future and add more colors, paintings and features.

Thank you for your time and assistance!
